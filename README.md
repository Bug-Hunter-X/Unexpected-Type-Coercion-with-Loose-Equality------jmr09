# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (`==`). Loose equality can lead to unexpected type coercion, causing subtle and hard-to-find errors in your code.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a function that might produce unexpected results due to the use of loose equality.  This can particularly affect null checks.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to avoid this issue by using strict equality (`===`) for null checks and explicit type handling to prevent unintended type coercion.  Strict equality is preferred for most cases to ensure that the equality check accounts for the data type and avoids the problems with type coercion.
